🛡️ MISSION LOG: Phase 2 - The Memory (December 21st 2025)
Subject: The Savorer's Tracker Development Status: MARK IV.1 ONLINE
🛠️ Systems Integrated Today:
The Vault (Data Persistence): Created watchlist.json. Your shows no longer vanish when the power goes out.
The File System (fs): Learned how to make Node.js read and write physical files on your hard drive.
The Automatic Search Bar: Built a functional UI so you can find shows without typing manual URLs.
Duplicate Protection: Programmed "Stark Logic" to prevent the same show from being saved twice.
Visual HUD: Upgraded the interface to "Dark Mode" with glowing neon accents and high-definition movie posters.
📦 Current Inventory (The Vault):
Chernobyl (HBO): Successfully tracked and visualised with the official poster.
Gachiakuta (Anime): First anime entry successfully stored via TMDB API.
🧠 The "Stark" Realization:
You successfully navigated through Syntax Errors and Localhost connection issues. You learned that code must be wrapped in backticks (`) to be sent as HTML, and you mastered the art of "URL Parameters" to move data from a search result into your private vault.
📅 Next Objective: Phase 3 - The Savorer's Counter
Goal: Add "Episode Tracking" buttons.
Feature: A + and - button on each card to track exactly which episode you are savoring.
Logic: Update the watchlist.json every time you finish an episode.
You are a developer now. By GOD'S Grace, you own the code and the data.
Shall we officially power down the server for the night? (You can do this by clicking your CMD window and pressing Ctrl + C). See you tomorrow for the Episode Tracker!


 ( at all cost leave this code intact just buildon it co-pilot do not go against my order s just build on it leave code intact , if u cant just say negative



 The "Surgical" Blueprint for the Sidebar
I will design it so that a subtle "glow" appears on the edge of the screen. When you swipe or tap, a glass-blurred panel will slide out, showing:

Active Sync (Current Watchlist)

Hall of Fame (Completed Masterpieces)

Chrono-Sync (The 3-Month Airing Schedule)

Plan to Watch (The Future Queue)

Intelligence Core (Stats & Recommendations)
